          <p>
            The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983
            for being “the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the
            universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage”. It is
            regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a
            symbol of India's rich history.
